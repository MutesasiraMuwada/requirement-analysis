## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a proposed software system. It serves as the foundation upon which the entire system is built, ensuring that developers, clients, and end-users are aligned in terms of goals, functionality, and expectations.

### Why It's Important in SDLC:

- **Foundation of Development:** Requirement analysis lays the groundwork for all future development activities. Without clear requirements, projects risk delays, budget overruns, or complete failure.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** It ensures that the software solution meets the actual needs of the users and stakeholders.
- **Scope Management:** Helps define and manage the project scope to prevent feature creep or misinterpretation.
- **Improved Design:** A thorough understanding of requirements leads to better architectural and technical design decisions.
- **Efficient Testing:** Requirements act as the baseline for creating test cases and validation procedures.
- **Risk Reduction:** Identifying potential issues early reduces the chances of costly changes later in the project.

In essence, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between what users need and what developers build, setting the stage for successful software project execution.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most crucial stages in software development because it directly impacts the success and quality of the final product. Below are three key reasons why it’s important:

### 1. Aligns Stakeholder Expectations

It ensures that the development team fully understands what the client and end-users need. This alignment reduces miscommunication and guarantees that the software delivers real value to its users.

### 2. Defines Clear Project Scope

Proper requirement analysis helps establish the project boundaries and deliverables. This clarity prevents scope creep and ensures that the project stays within budget and timeline.

### 3. Reduces Development Risks

By identifying requirements early, potential risks and issues can be discovered and addressed before they become costly problems later in the project. It also provides a basis for validating and verifying the software through testing.

### 4. Enhances Quality and Usability

Clearly defined requirements lead to better software design and implementation. This results in a product that is easier to use, maintain, and scale over time.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis phase involves several key activities that help translate business needs into actionable system requirements. These activities ensure that the final product aligns with stakeholder expectations and system goals.

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This is the initial step where raw data about the desired system is collected from stakeholders, including clients, end-users, and subject matter experts. Techniques include interviews, questionnaires, observations, and review of existing documentation.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Elicitation involves extracting detailed and accurate requirements through structured techniques such as workshops, brainstorming sessions, use case analysis, and prototyping. It ensures clarity and completeness of stakeholder needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  All gathered and elicited requirements are recorded in a structured format (like a Software Requirements Specification - SRS document). Clear documentation ensures traceability, reference, and consistency throughout the development cycle.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  This activity focuses on reviewing, refining, organizing, and modeling requirements using tools like flowcharts, entity-relationship diagrams, and use case diagrams. It helps identify dependencies, conflicts, and redundancies in the requirements.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Validation ensures that the documented requirements meet business objectives and stakeholder expectations. It often involves walkthroughs, reviews, and approval sessions with stakeholders to confirm accuracy and feasibility.
  ## Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are categorized into two main types: Functional and Non-functional. Both are essential to ensure that a system operates correctly and efficiently.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe **what the system should do** — the specific behaviors, services, and functions it must support.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- Users must be able to register and log in to their accounts.
- The system should allow users to search for available bookings by date, time, and location.
- Admins can add, update, or delete booking slots.
- The system should send confirmation emails to users upon successful booking.
- Users should be able to cancel or reschedule bookings through the system interface.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define **how the system performs** its functions. These include usability, reliability, security, and performance aspects.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- The system should load booking search results in under 2 seconds.
- User data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit.
- The platform must be available 99.9% of the time.
- The interface should be mobile-responsive and accessible.
- The system must support up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are a visual representation of the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help identify system functionalities (use cases) from the user's perspective, making it easier to capture requirements and plan features.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- Clarify system behavior and scope
- Identify key actors and their interactions with the system
- Enhance communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Serve as a blueprint for feature development and testing

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are a set of predefined requirements that a software product must meet to be accepted by the user, customer, or other stakeholders. These criteria define the scope, desired outcomes, and boundaries for a particular feature or user story.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria:
- **Clarifies Expectations**: Ensures that the development team and stakeholders are aligned on what constitutes a "done" feature.
- **Drives Test Cases**: Provides a clear basis for writing test cases and validating functionality.
- **Reduces Miscommunication**: Prevents ambiguity in requirements and development by specifying measurable goals.
- **Supports Agile Development**: In Agile environments, acceptance criteria are used to define when a user story can be marked as complete.

### Example: Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature

**Feature**: User checks out and confirms a booking

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The user must be logged in to access the checkout page.
- The booking summary is displayed with selected date, time, and location.
- The system calculates and displays the total price including any applicable taxes or discounts.
- The user can choose a payment method (e.g., credit card, mobile money).
- Upon successful payment, the system sends a confirmation email to the user.
- The booking is marked as confirmed in the system database.
- If payment fails, the user receives a clear error message and remains on the checkout page.
